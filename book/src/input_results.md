# Input & Results
These are the two main ways values are persisted for future use in an expression. Both of these values may be accessed but not changed.

## Input
Accessed with the `$` symbol, there is a single input per expression.

## Results
An expression is made up of sub-expressions. Each sub expression creates a result. The most recent result can be accessed with the `?` symbol.
