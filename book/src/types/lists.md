# Lists
Store many values together with lists, created by separating values with a comma. Lists can contain any type of values.
```
100, 200, 300

100, "words", :my_symbol, false, (), "one" = 100
```

Parenthesis are optional for a single list but can help with readability. However, parenthesis are required when a nested list is desired.
```
(100, 200, 300)

(10, 20), (30, 40), (50, 60)
```
